# Join Next Zoom Meeting Plugin

This is a plugin that automatically joins your next zoom meeting. I am an
engineering manager, so naturally 90% of my time is spent on Zoom. Being able to
join my next meeting at the click of a button is key to my day-to-day.

Eventually, I want to add configurability for how far into the future this
looks, and maybe resolution for double booking.
